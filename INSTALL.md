The repository link for each theme is provided by the author on the theme topic. There are also options to import from a specific branch and to specify whether the repository is private.

If you import a theme component, you need to also add it to your actives themes. This is covered in detail in the next section.

<h4 id="heading--2">Add theme components to a theme</h4>

Let's say you like the [Discourse category banners](https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourse-category-banners/86241) theme component and want to use it. You would proceed as follows

1. import the theme from the repository like we discussed above
2. add it as a theme component to your active / user-selectable themes

You can add the component your theme(s) using the "Include component on these themes" setting:

You can also add components from a theme's overview using the "Included components" setting:

<h4 id="heading--3">Checking for updates</h4>

Sometimes the themes or components you install will have updates.

If a theme or component has updates, an icon will display next to its name like so

If you select that theme or component you can update it with one click by clicking on the update button here:
